MWatch Agents Down in Ptest





 7 Ptest servers were up but agent was down in the servers.We tried to restart the agent but we were getting HQ Server/port connectivity not available  error.

When checked with core team , and after updating the agent.setup.camPword in the server we were able to restart the agent.

Currently all the servers/agents are up and running fine.
